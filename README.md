# Door Contact Sensor
A simple sensor based on the ATmega328P that makes a ringing sound effect each time a door or window opens. The HC-SR04 sensor produces sound waves that reflect on the door surface. When a sound wave is produced, the microcontroller starts a timer and an interrupt occurs if the sensor receives the wave back. 

# Schematic
We will need :
- ATmega328P 
- HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor
- Buzzer
- 100 Î© Resistor
